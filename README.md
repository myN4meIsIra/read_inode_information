# read_inode_information

This program is designed to take the absolute pathname for a file and read some of the inode information for that file.

# Execution:
To execute this file, simply call the "make" function, then call with "./<localDirectory> <pathname/to/file>"
If there is an error in your pathname, (ex: it does not lead to a file, or a directory does not exist, etc.) then an error message explaining will be outputted.
